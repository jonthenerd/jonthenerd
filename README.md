## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jon Badgett (@jonthenerd)

I'm an optimistic pragmatist leveraging Azure, .NET, TypeScript, React, PowerShell, Linux (and many other interesting technologies) 
to build awesome solutions. I believe in hard work, excellent results, and the power of positive attitude and praise.

My goal is to love what I do, and have those I work with do the same. If it's worth doing, it's worth doing better. If it's technical or tastes good, 
I'm probably interested. 

### ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jon-badgett/) is probably best for folks that haven't met me in person.
